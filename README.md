# ArmWithCNN
Application of Convolutional Neural Networks to a robotics project with Arduino.

This project is meant to be used on an Arduino Uno Board. 

Prediction.py is the script where the CNN architecture YoloV8 makes predictions on real-time video and communicates the information to the Arduino Board.

The YoloV8 model was constructed and pre-trained in Google Collab for speed purposes.
